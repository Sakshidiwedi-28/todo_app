 Enhance the basic To-Do application by integrating external API data, 
 implementing advanced state management using Redux, 
 and ensuring the application is responsive and user-friendly across different devices.
 Definition:
 Basically this application is done the task with to-do set reminder you can keep scehdule any task and it keeps as reminder. 
 tools:
 
 Frontend Development And API Integration :
 Utilize HTML to structure the application's layout.
Use CSS for styling the application. Feel free to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for design components.
Implement the application logic using JavaScript (ES6 or later).
Integrate with a public API (e.g., a weather API) to display data relevant to the tasks. For example, if a task is related to an outdoor activity, show the current weather conditions.
Implement error handling for the API requests to manage and display errors gracefully in the UI.

 React Components And Advanced State Management::
Develop the application using functional components and demonstrate the use of React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
The application should have at least two components:    
TaskInput: A component for adding a new task.
TaskList: A component for displaying the list of tasks.
Use Redux Thunk or Redux Saga for handling asynchronous actions (e.g., API calls).
Responsive Design: 
Ensure the application is fully responsive and provides an excellent user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to achieve responsiveness.
Implement a mobile-first design approach..![Screenshot 2025-01-26 174017](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d93baef-5b95-423c-8293-a3d20f7ecf62)

Functionality:
Add Task: Users should be able to input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
View Tasks: Display all added tasks in a list format.
Delete Task: Each task should have a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
Task Prioritization: Allow users to set priorities for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and display them accordingly.
Persistent Storage: Use local storage or session storage to save tasks and authentication status, ensuring data persistence across browser sessions.
User Authentication:
Add a simple user authentication feature (login/logout functionality) that simulates the process using Redux for state management. There's no need to integrate with a backend; you can mock the authentication process.
Protect the To-Do list behind authentication, ensuring that tasks are only visible to logged-in use![Screenshot 2025-01-26 174105](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6742f514-4482-4485-b19c-92592c4d9aaa)
